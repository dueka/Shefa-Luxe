                    In most cases, any customs or import duties are charged once the
                    parcel reaches its destination country.
      
                    <span class="accordion-link"> Will i be charged handling fees or taxes?</span>
      
                    You may be charged for handling fees and taxes as your order
                    passes through customs. Any charges on a parcel must be paid by
                    the person receiving the parcel (this also applies to retail &
                    wholesale customers.)

                      How will i be charged for customs and import charges?</span
                    >
                    Shefa Luxe has not control over these charges and we can't tell
                    you what the cost would be, as customs policies and import duties
                    vary widely from country to country. It's a good idea to contact
                    your local customs office for current charges before you order, so
                    you are not surprised by the charges.
